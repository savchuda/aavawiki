# DISCLAIMER

This framework is intended for personal work or group work on oneself. It is not a school assignment or homework, and there is no need to report to anyone. It is self-work, meant to be sincere with yourself. This framework helps to understand what the true goal is and how to achieve it specifically for you, precisely when it is needed. It is recommended to carry out this work ON PAPER.

# INTRO: FULL ALGORITHM

1. In planning, you are always concerned with answering three questions: What? Why? How? These should not be confused, as they are interconnected: What? does not exist without Why? and How? Always start with What? and finish with How? This process will guide you in answering them.

2. In planning, always move from general to specific, from abstract to concrete, from large to small—in other words, from concept/idea to specific tasks.

3. Planning always follows a step-by-step approach:
   - First, formulate the concept — Point B
   - Then determine where you are now in relation to the goal — Point A
   - Next, explore ways to achieve the goal
   - Plan actions
   - Plan the completion

4. Do not answer all questions at once.

5. Work thoughtfully and deeply, as detailed as possible.

6. Forget the approach of "making the first steps within the first 24/72 hours" at the planning stage.

7. Remember, this is just a plan that you will later adjust, rewrite, use as a base, and sometimes deviate from.

# STEP 1: "Formulating the Concept" - POINT B

1. Approach your life as a project. Can you describe your life in the foreseeable future as a set of completed projects (goals)? Imagine that your goals have been achieved. What would your life look like, say, in a year? For now, do not worry about how you will achieve it; we will address this later. Write a short essay as if everything is already implemented, in the present tense. This answers "What?" Avoid the "American Dream" format.

2. What areas (real or conceptual) are currently in your focus?

3. Which of these present the greatest challenge?

4. Which seem most appealing?

5. Which are the highest priority? Explain why.

6. If you were to preliminarily break down each priority goal into stages and describe each stage as a completed result, what would that look like? No detailed planning here, just an outline.

7. How much time do you think each stage might take?

8. By what time do you need these goals to be completed?

9. How will achieving each goal impact your life as a whole?

10. How will achieving each goal affect your quality of life?

11. What new opportunities will each goal's achievement open up for you?

12. Who needs to approve these goals with you?

13. Do these goals motivate, stimulate, and inspire you?

14. What is most important to focus on in the "Formulating the Concept" section?

# STEP 2: "Present Moment" - POINT A

1. Honestly describe where you currently stand concerning these goals.

2. What specifically dissatisfies you, what are you unhappy with, what do you want to change?

3. How could this look differently?

4. Who is responsible for implementing your plans?

5. What depends solely on you and your team? What depends on others?

6. What resources do you already have: experience, time, money, support, skills?

7. What additional resources are needed?

8. Where can you find these resources?

9. What disruptions might arise when achieving these goals?

10. What can you do right now to prevent them?

11. What resources are necessary for this?

12. Who do you need to tell about this goal, with whom should you share it?

13. Do the answers in the "Present Moment" section affect the "Formulating the Concept" section? If yes, make adjustments to the Concept.

14. What is most important to focus on in the "Present Moment" section?

# STEP 3: METHODS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL

1. Your complete list of all possible ways to achieve this goal—realistic/unrealistic, big/small, partial/full?

2. What else could you do if you had more time, more money, if everything was entirely in your control?

3. What else could you do if you could start from scratch or with a new team?

4. What are the pros and cons of each option?

5. Which solutions attract you the most?

6. Which methods do you resist? Explain.

7. Which method do you think will lead to the most favorable result the quickest?

8. What is the most important thing to focus on in the "Methods to Achieve the Goal" section?

9. Do the answers in the "Methods to Achieve the Goal" section affect the Concept? If "yes," make the appropriate adjustments to the Concept.

# STEP 4: ACTIONS

1. If you specify and describe each stage in terms of time, how would it look? Possible action algorithm:

2. Take your goal and start tying it to reality—think about the timeframe you want to implement it in, and describe it as a concrete, completed result tied to that timeframe, as if it is already achieved.

3. Then work backward from the future to one year or another chosen timeframe, answering:
   - What interim result in nine months will indicate you are on track?
   - What interim result in six months will indicate you are on track?
   - What interim result in three months will indicate you are on track?
   - What interim result in one month will indicate you are on track?

4. What steps are you planning to take immediately?

5. What support do you need for this?

6. How and from whom can you obtain this support? What can you do toward this right now?

7. How would you rate your commitment to this action plan on a scale of 1-10?

8. If it’s not a 10, what prevents you from giving it a 10?

9. What are the "missing points"?

10. What is the most important thing to focus on in the "Actions" section?

11. Do the answers in the "Actions" section affect the Concept? If "yes," make the appropriate adjustments to the Concept.

# STEP 5: COMPLETION

1. Who do you need to inform when the goal is achieved?

2. What will you think of yourself? What will you feel?

3. How does achieving this goal affect other areas of your development?

4. How does achieving this goal affect your company, your professional community?

5. What new opportunities does achieving this goal open for you?

6. Who needs to be thanked?

7. With whom and how do you plan to celebrate the achievement of this goal?

8. What is the most important thing to focus on in the "Completion" section?
