# What we begin from as leader
# Tabs {.tabset}
## Leadership importance
> Several theories & types exist as "Transformational Leadership Theory", "Situational Leadership Theory", "Leader Member Exchange Theory (LMX)", lets focus here on PLSQ "The Power and Leadership Style Questionnaire"
>
> Leadership types vary in how they approach decision-making, team dynamics, and motivation. Key styles include Autocratic (directive control), Democratic (collaborative input), Transformational (inspirational vision), Transactional (performance-focused rewards), Laissez-Faire (hands-off autonomy), and Servant (people-first support), each with unique strengths suited to different organizational needs and goals.

## PSQL (math based)
> The Psychodynamic Leadership Styles Questionnaire assesses leadership styles based on psychodynamic theory, focusing on unconscious motivations and interpersonal dynamics that influence how individuals lead. This questionnaire helps leaders identify underlying patterns, emotional drivers, and relational tendencies that shape their leadership approach. By exploring factors like attachment style, defense mechanisms, and interpersonal preferences, the tool enables leaders to gain deeper self-awareness, manage personal biases, and improve their relational effectiveness within teams. It is valuable for understanding how unconscious influences affect leadership behavior, decision-making, and team interactions, promoting a more reflective, adaptable leadership style.

# Triving the communication
# Tabs {.tabset}
## Overview
> Communication theories explain how people share and interpret information across different situations. They explore various ways communication works, such as sending messages clearly (linear models), adapting based on feedback (transactional models), or building trust through gradual sharing (social penetration). Understanding these theories helps improve clarity, strengthen relationships, and make interactions more effective.
>
> Some of the most popular communication theories include the Shannon-Weaver Model (linear communication), Transactional Model (dynamic feedback), Social Penetration Theory (relationship-building through self-disclosure), and Media Richness Theory (choosing the right communication method based on message complexity).

## DISC Assessment
> The **DISC Assessment** is a personality test used in business settings to evaluate four primary behavioral traits: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness. It helps individuals and teams understand their communication styles, strengths, and areas for development, fostering better collaboration and conflict resolution. Often used in hiring, team-building, and leadership training, DISC provides valuable insights into how people approach tasks, interact with others, and handle challenges.
