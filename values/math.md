# Self-Regulation Questionnaires (SRQ) 

The Self-Regulation Questionnaires (SRQ) assess individuals' motivations behind their behaviors, distinguishing between autonomous (self-driven) and controlled (externally pressured) forms of regulation. Based on Self-Determination Theory, SRQs are used in different life areas, such as learning, health, and exercise, to evaluate the degree of intrinsic motivation versus extrinsic control. The SRQ helps identify factors that promote self-motivation, enhancing well-being and persistence in various activities.
