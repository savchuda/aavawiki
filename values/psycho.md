# Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scales (BPNSS)
The Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scales (BPNSS) measure the fulfillment of three core psychological needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—based on Self-Determination Theory. These scales assess how well individuals feel their needs are met in various life domains, such as work, relationships, or education. High satisfaction on the BPNSS is linked to greater well-being, motivation, and positive engagement.
